    <h2>Introduction to Coffee</h2>

    <aside>
        <blockquote> We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a
            little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.</blockquote>
        - Jerry Seinfeld

        <p>Coffee is a beverage made by grinding roasted coffee beans and allowing hot water to flow through them. Dark,
            flavorful, and aromatic, the resulting liquid is usually served hot, when its full flavor can best be
            appreciated. Coffee is served internationally—with over one third of the world's population consuming it in
            some form, it ranks as the most popular processed beverage—and each country has developed its own
            preferences about how to prepare and present it. For example, coffee drinkers in Indonesia drink hot coffee
            from glasses, while Middle Easterners and some Africans serve their coffee in dainty brass cups. The
            Italians are known for their espresso, a thick brew served in tiny cups and made by dripping hot water over
            twice the normal quantity of ground coffee, and the French have contributed café au lait, a combination of
            coffee and milk or cream which they consume from bowls at breakfast.</p>

        <p>A driving force behind coffee's global popularity is its caffeine content: a six-ounce (2.72 kilograms) cup
            of coffee contains 100 milligrams of caffeine, more than comparable amounts of tea (50 milligrams), cola (25
            milligrams), or cocoa (15 milligrams). Caffeine, an alkaloid that occurs naturally in coffee, is a mild
            stimulant that produces a variety of physical effects. Because caffeine stimulates the cortex of the brain,
            people who ingest it experience enhanced concentration. Athletes are sometimes advised to drink coffee prior
            to competing, as caffeine renders skeletal muscles less susceptible to exhaustion and improves coordination.
            However, these benefits accrue only to those who consume small doses of the drug. Excessive amounts of
            caffeine produce a host of undesirable consequences, acting as a diuretic, stimulating gastric secretions,
            upsetting the stomach, contracting blood vessels in the brain (people who suffer from headaches are advised
            to cut their caffeine intake), and causing overacute sensation, irregular heartbeat, and trembling. On a
            more serious level, many researchers have sought to link caffeine to heart disease, benign breast cysts,
            pancreatic cancer, and birth defects. While such studies have proven inconclusive, health official
            nonetheless recommend that people limit their coffee intake to fewer than four cups daily or drink
            decaffeinated varieties.</p>

        <p>Coffee originated on the plateaus of central Ethiopia. By A.D. 1000, Ethiopian Arabs were collecting the
            fruit of the tree, which grew wild, and preparing a beverage from its beans. During the fifteenth century
            traders transplanted wild coffee trees from Africa to southern Arabia. The eastern Arabs, the first to
            cultivate coffee, soon adopted the Ethiopian Arabs' practice of making a hot beverage from its ground,
            roasted beans.</p>

        <p>The Arabs' fondness for the drink spread rapidly along trade routes, and Venetians had been introduced to
            coffee by 1600. In Europe as in Arabia, church and state officials frequently proscribed the new drink,
            identifying it with the often-liberal discussions conducted by coffee house habitués, but the institutions
            nonetheless proliferated, nowhere more so than in seventeenth-century London. The first coffee house opened
            there in 1652, and a large number of such establishments (café;s) opened soon after on both the European
            continent (café derives from the French term for coffee) and in North America, where they appeared in such
            Eastern cities as New York, Boston, and Philadelphia in the last decade of the seventeenth century.</p>
