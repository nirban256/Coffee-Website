        <p>Coffee comes from the seed, or bean, of the coffee tree. Coffee beans contain more than 100 chemicals
            including aromatic molecules, proteins, starches, oils, and bitter phenols (acidic compounds), each
            contributing a different characteristic to the unique flavor of coffee. The coffee tree, a member of the
            evergreen family, has waxy, pointed leaves and jasmine-like flowers. Actually more like a shrub, the coffee
            tree can grow to more than 30 feet (9.14 meters) in its wild state, but in cultivation it is usually trimmed
            to between five and 12 feet (1.5 and 3.65 meters). After planting, the typical tree will not produce coffee
            beans until it blooms, usually about five years. After the white petals drop off, red cherries form, each
            with two green coffee beans inside. (Producing mass quantities of beans requires a large number of trees: in
            one year, a small bush will yield only enough beans for a pound of coffee.) Because coffee berries do not
            ripen uniformly, careful harvesting requires picking only the red ripe berries: including unripened green
            ones and overly ripened black ones will affect the coffee taste.</p>

        <p>Coffee trees grow best in a temperate climate without frost or high temperatures. They also seem to thrive in
            fertile, well-drained soil; volcanic soil in particular seems conducive to flavorful beans. High altitude
            plantations located between 3,000 and 6,000 feet (914.4 and 1,828.8 meters) above sea level produce
            low-moisture beans with more flavor. Due to the positive influences of volcanic soil and altitude, the
            finest beans are often cultivated in mountainous regions. Today, Brazil produces about half of the world's
            coffee. One quarter is produced elsewhere in Latin America, and Africa contributes about one sixth of the
            global supply.</p>

        <p>Currently, about 25 types of coffee trees exist, the variation stemming from environmental factors such as
            soil, weather, and altitude. The two main species are coffea robusta and coffea arabica. The robusta strain
            produces less expensive beans, largely because it can be grown under less ideal conditions than the arabica
            strain. When served, coffee made from arabica beans has a deep reddish cast, whereas robusta brews tend to
            be dark brown or black in appearance. The coffees made from the two commonly used beans differ
            significantly. Robusta beans are generally grown on large plantations where the berries ripen and are
            harvested at one time, thereby increasing the percentage of under- and over-ripe beans. Arabica beans, on
            the other hand, comprise the bulk of the premium coffees that are typically sold in whole bean form so
            purchasers can grind their own coffee. Whether served in a coffee house or prepared at home, coffee made
            from such beans offers a more delicate and less acidic flavor.</p>
