    <p>The whole coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.</p>

    <p>The fineness of the grind strongly affects brewing. Brewing methods that expose coffee grounds to heated water
        for longer require a coarser grind than faster brewing methods. Beans that are too finely ground for the brewing
        method in which they are used will expose too much surface area to the heated water and produce a bitter, harsh,
        "over-extracted" taste. At the other extreme, an overly coarse grind will produce weak coffee unless more is
        used. Due to the importance of a grind's fineness, a uniform grind is highly desirable.</p>

    <p>If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable,
        then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses
        less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless used to
        grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. A fine grind allows the most efficient extraction but
        coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or screening.</p>

    <p>Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater surface area exposed to oxygen. Many
        coffee drinkers grind the beans themselves immediately before brewing.</p>

    <p>Spent coffee grinds can be reused for hair care or skin care as well as in the garden. These can also be used as
        biodiesel fuel.[1]</p>

    <p>There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:

        <p>Burr grinder interior</p>

        <p></p>Turkish manual coffee and pepper grinders</p>

        <p>Various grinders for coffee and spices</p>
        <p>Burr mills use two revolving abrasive elements, such as wheels or conical grinding elements, between which
            the
            coffee beans are crushed or "torn" with little frictional heating. The process of squeezing and crushing of
            the
            beans releases the coffee's oils, which are then more easily extracted during the infusion process with hot
            water, making the coffee taste richer and smoother.</p>

        <p>Both manually and electrically powered mills are available. These mills grind the coffee to a fairly uniform
            size
            determined by the separation of the two abrasive surfaces between which the coffee is ground; the uniform
            grind
            produces a more even extraction when brewed, without excessively fine particles that clog filters.</p>

        <p>These mills offer a wide range of grind settings, making them suitable to grind coffee for various brewing
            systems such as espresso, drip, percolators, French press, and others. Many burr grinders, including almost
            all
            domestic versions, are unable to achieve the extremely fine grind required for the preparation of Turkish
            coffee; traditional Turkish hand grinders are an exception.</p>

        <p>Burr grinders are of two types - conical burrs and flat wheel burrs. Both of them grind coffee bean
            consistently
            and with uniform size. Almost every burr coffee grinder grinds at low noise, offer large hopper for storing
            whole coffee bean, easy to use with portafilter for espresso grind, body made with stainless steel or
            ceramic
            with modern design as well as slow operating system ensures find grind all the time.

        <h3 id="chopping">Chopping</h3>

        <p>A blade or propeller grinder</p>
        <p>Coffee beans can be chopped by using blades rotating at high speed (20,000 to 30,000 rpm), either in a blade
            grinder designed specifically for coffee and spices, or in a general use home blender. Devices of this sort
            are
            cheaper than burr grinders, but the grind is not uniform and will produce particles of widely varying sizes,
            while ideally all particles should have the same size, appropriate for the method of brewing. Moreover, the
            particles get smaller and smaller during the grinding process, which makes it difficult to achieve a
            consistent
            grind from batch to batch.</p>

        <p>Blade grinders create “coffee dust” that can clog up sieves in espresso machines and French presses, and are
            best
            suited for drip coffee makers. They are not recommended for grinding coffee for use with pump espresso
            machines.

        <h3 id="pounding">Pounding</h3>

        <p>Arabic coffee and Turkish coffee require that the grounds be almost powdery in fineness, finer than can be
            achieved by most burr grinders. Pounding the beans with a mortar and pestle can pulverise the coffee finely
            enough.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3 id="roller-grinder">Roller grinding</h3>

        <p>In a roller grinder, the beans are ground between pairs of corrugated rollers. A roller grinder produces a
            more
            even grind size distribution and heats the ground coffee less than other grinding methods. However, due to
            their
            size and cost, roller grinders are used exclusively by commercial and industrial scale coffee producers.</p>

        <p>Water-cooled roller grinders are used for high production rates as well as for fine grinds such as Turkish
            and
            espresso.</p>
