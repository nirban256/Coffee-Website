        <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee beans into roasted coffee
            products.
            The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee beans
            to
            change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher levels of acids, protein, sugars, and
            caffeine as
            those that have been roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard and other
            chemical
            reactions that occur during roasting.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but small-scale commercial roasting has
            grown
            significantly with the trend toward "single-origin" coffees served at specialty shops. Some coffee drinkers
            even
            roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavor profile of the beans and ensure
            the
            freshest possible roast.</p>

        <p>The first recorded implements for roasting coffee beans were thin pans made from metal or porcelain, used in
            the
            15th century in the Ottoman Empire and Greater Persia. In the 19th century, various patents were awarded in
            the U.S.
            and Europe for commercial roasters, to allow for large batches of coffee. In the 1950s just as instant
            coffee was
            becoming a popular coffee drink, speciality coffee-houses began opening to cater to the connoisseur,
            offering a more
            traditionally brewed beverage. In the 1970s, more speciality coffee houses were founded, ones that offered a
            variety
            of roasts and beans from around the world. In the 1980s and 1990s, the gourmet coffee industry experienced
            great
            growth. This trend continued into the 21st Century.</p>
